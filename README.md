# cluster-Algoritam
A clustering algorithm is a machine learning technique that organizes data points into groups, or clusters, based on similarities. Clustering algorithms are unsupervised, meaning they work on unlabeled data.
 step 1. Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset

    Load the Dataset:
        Import the Iris dataset from the sklearn.datasets module.
        The dataset contains four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and a target variable (species).

    Preprocessing:
        Drop the species column (target variable) since clustering is unsupervised.
        Ensure the data is normalized or scaled if required (e.g., using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler) to improve clustering performance.

Step 2: Apply Clustering Algorithms
A) KMeans Clustering

    Explain the Algorithm:
        KMeans divides data into k clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.
        Iteratively refines cluster centroids until convergence.

    Steps:
        Import KMeans from sklearn.cluster.
        Choose the number of clusters k (commonly 3 for Iris, as there are 3 species).
        Apply the KMeans algorithm to the preprocessed data.
        Predict the cluster assignments for each data point.
        Visualize the clusters using scatter plots (e.g., for the first two features or using PCA for dimensionality reduction).

B) Hierarchical Clustering

    Explain the Algorithm:
        Hierarchical clustering creates a dendrogram to group similar data points. It can be:
            Agglomerative: Start with individual points and merge clusters.
            Divisive: Start with all points as one cluster and split iteratively.

    Steps:
        Import AgglomerativeClustering and dendrogram from relevant libraries.
        Choose the number of clusters (e.g., 3 for Iris).
        Apply Agglomerative Clustering on the preprocessed data.
        Visualize clusters using scatter plots.
        (Optional) Plot the dendrogram to show hierarchical relationships.

Step 3: Evaluation and Visualization

    Plot the results for each algorithm:
        Use color-coded scatter plots to represent cluster assignments.
        Use dendrograms for Hierarchical Clustering to observe the hierarchy.

    (Optional) Compare the clusters to the original species labels (though not required in unsupervised learning).
